Photosynthesis is a biological process that occurs in plants and some other organisms where light energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose (sugar). This process takes place in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll and other pigments that absorb light. CO2 is taken in from the air and combined with water in the presence of light to form glucose and oxygen through the reaction 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2. The glucose produced is used by the plant as food, while the oxygen is released into the air as a by-product. This process is the primary source of energy for most life on Earth and helps maintain the balance of oxygen in the atmosphere.
