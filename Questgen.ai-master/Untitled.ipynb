      "Artiﬁcial neural networks allowed to achieve extraordinary results in diverse ﬁelds,\n",

      "As part of a company project in Fluentify - online teaching platform -, this study has\n",
      "been conducted with two main goals: from one side, discovering and analysing the\n",
      "latest state-of-the-art technologies to deal with the problem of understanding the\n",
      "main topics of a given text, generating meaningful multiple-choice questions related\n",

      "applying and testing such models on a series of text paragraphs and evaluating the\n",
      "results in order to detect how well they perform and how they can be improved.\n",
      "Even though all these steps already have several possible state-of-the-art solutions,\n",
      "composing them together was the real challenge, as not every workﬂow proved to\n",
      "be eﬀective in reaching the ultimate goal of obtaining meaningful exercises.\n",
      "The ﬁrst chapter of this thesis gives an overview about the context, explaining\n",
      "the issues and the needs related to natural language processing tasks and its main\n",
      "applications in the real world.\n",

      "the-art architecture that deals with such tasks.\n",
      "The third chapter describes the algorithms used for the experimental tests, and\n",
      "gives details on the speciﬁc models that underlie them.\n",
      "The fourth chapter illustrates how these tests have been conducted, explaining the\n",

      "today, lots of ﬁelds take advantage of AI, and it seems hard not to ﬁnd areas where\n",
      "this is not used; however, despite its large aﬀect on everyday life, it is undeniable\n",
      "that this process is at the very beginning and that there is, nevertheless, room for\n",
      "improvement.\n",
      "Among the diverse ﬁelds Artiﬁcial Intelligence is related to, Natural Language\n",
      "Processing is certainly one of the most complex to work on, but, at the same time,\n",
      "extremely powerful and useful when it comes to e-learning.\n",
      "1.2 NLP\n",
      "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to refer to a ﬁeld of research that\n",
      "involves computer science, AI and linguistic to let computers properly understand\n",
      "natural language, i.e. language used by humans, both written and spoken. This\n",

      "human language on every matter: words and their meaning with respect to the\n",
      "context they are used, phrases and their grammar structure, sentiment of the\n",
      "sentences, etc.\n",
      "1.2.1 History\n",
      "A recent work by P. Johri et al. [1] gives a good summary about the way NLP\n",
      "started and developed through the last century.\n",
      "The ﬁrst attempts on this matter can be found in mid-1930s, when some patents\n",
      "for translating machines made their appearance. The goal was to use bilingual\n",
      "2\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "dictionaries to map words between languages, but, despite the eﬀort on using\n",
      "innovating approaches that could not struggle with the grammar of the language,\n",
      "those systems did not have concrete use and remained just abstract concepts. It\n",
      "was during World War II that NLP was successfully used in a practical context: on\n",
      "one side, Germans built a machine called \"Enigma\" to encrypt messages and create\n",
      "a secret code to facilitate their communications, whereas, on the other one, British\n",
      "came up with a computer able to decrypt Enigma codes. Soon after, in 1950, in his\n",
      "article \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" [2], Alan Turing proposed a new\n",
      "criterion to assess level of intelligence of machines, called \"Turing test\": the test\n",
      "aimed to determine whether a computer could actually think as a human or not.\n",
      "Further studies and attempts were made during the following decades, with several\n",
      "and diﬀerent approaches; however, they were all based on handwritten rules that\n",
      "struggled to deal with real-world situations due to the huge complexity and variety\n",
      "of human language structures; indeed, ﬁxed rules were not able to understand\n",
      "the proper words meaning or grammar of the sentences, thus giving insuﬃcient\n",
      "results. A real revolution only happened in late 1980s, with introduction of machine\n",
      "learning and focus on statistical and probabilistic models that allowed to overcome\n",
      "such ambiguity: algorithms did not have to match hand-written patterns anymore;\n",
      "instead, they learned from the context and made proper choices on a decision\n",
      "tree-like structure by taking advantage of the probabilistic model. Due to the\n",
      "successful results, research relied on that for years, until deep learning and neural\n",
      "networks came up at the end of the ﬁrst decade of 2000, resulting in techniques\n",
      "that are still used today and provide the current state-of-the-art results. Deep\n",
      "learning based approach has really proved to be the right way to work with NLP,\n",
      "giving the possibility to reach a better understanding of the text through a deep\n",
      "awareness of the neighbouring objects.\n",
      "It is not accidental that deep learning-based NLP unleashed its real power only in\n",
      "recent years. Indeed, there are mainly two reasons for that.\n",
      "First of all, these algorithms proved to be extremely burdensome when it came to\n",
      "3\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "hardware requirements. Processors did not use to be as high performance and fast as\n",
      "today, that is, computational cost and time to perform such tasks were not feasible.\n",
      "This was a real limit for NLP - and deep learning, more generally - development,\n",
      "and technological progress for sure helped on reaching big results. Not only was\n",
      "the hardware availability inadequate, but also, in order for these deep learning\n",
      "algorithms to work well, tons of data were needed. Before digital transformation and\n",
      "introduction of online services, the amount of information produced was scarce and\n",
      "insuﬃcient to be eﬀective in terms of Natural Language Processing development.\n",
      "However, today is diﬀerent: ﬁrst of all, with advent of social media and personal\n",

      "used to be stored only physically as papers - especially banks, private companies\n",
      "or public administration related - and computerisation of business processes have\n",

      "1.2.2 Applications\n",
      "As previously stated, Natural Language Processing is widely used today, as several\n",
      "are the tools available to help accomplishing diﬀerent tasks. They can ﬁnd utility\n",
      "among both private users, who take advantage of these during everyday life, and\n",
      "business companies, that keep implementing such tools to gain valuable insights\n",
      "and enrich the product with features to excel among the competitors.\n",
      "Some of the main techniques based on NLP and their applications are:\n",

      "Features like autocorrection and automplete are among the most used, and almost\n",
      "everyone takes advantage of them every day.\n",
      "Autocomplete, also known as auto prediction, allows people to save time by guessing\n",

      "used on search engines, but it founds application also on emails clients to speed up\n",
      "emails composition.\n",
      "Autocorrection, on the other hand, is able to detect any grammar or spelling\n",
      "mistakes during writing and to give hints to the user in order to ﬁx or rephrase\n",
      "what is pointed out as incorrect.\n",
      "Chatbots & Virtual Assistants\n",

      "Text Classiﬁcation\n",
      "Manually processing an unstructured text and categorising it can be a hard and\n",
      "time-consuming operation, since natural language is extremely rich in terms of\n",
      "content diversity. For this reason, text classiﬁcation systems have been developed\n",
